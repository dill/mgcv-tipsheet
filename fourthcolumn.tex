    \begin{itemize}
      \item Top left: Quantile-quantile plot: points should be close to the line, meaning residuals are normally distributed.
      \item Bottom left: Histogram of residuals: again, looking for normal(ish) distribution.
      \item Top right: Residuals vs. linear predictor: looking for no increase or decrease in spread with increasing linear predictor value, otherwise we have heteroskedasticity.
      \item Bottom right: Response vs. linear predictor, expecting tight line relationship indicating good agreement between the predictions and data.
